# WeatherApp
<br>
This is a simple weather app that loads data from a weather api. The user can search cities, save a list of cities in a profile and load profiles.<br>
<br>
Created with: Angular 5<br>
<br>
Known bug:<br>
<br>
Currently a city must be pasted in at once into the search bar else the app with cease to work. This will be addressed much farther down the line as this app not currently a priority.<br>
<br>
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
